          </h2>
          <p> Brad Frost video talked about the growth of the internet and how much bullshit has devoloped. It has become so easy for people to get online and participate that we have an constant flow in media being thrown at us. It is not individuals doing this, but also companies always trying to advertise to us even when we dont want it. For example before we can watch a youtube video we have to watch a 30 second commercial. Or if we try to enter a website we have to click past a couple pop ups before we enter the site. This is all bullshit to him. As he starts to explain, we find ways to filter out the bad things and get to the good thngs that can be beneficial. Things such as amazon reviews or movie reviews help us save some time and find the good from bad. </p>

      <h1>Designing with details</h1>
          <h3>Dan Staffer</h3>

          <p>Dan Staffer's lecture was about websites and all the different microinteractions that take place. A microinteraction is just one single interaction or task. Some examples of microinteractions are
              <ul>
          <li>setting your alarm</li>
                  <li>liking a post on facebook</li>
                  <li>pick a password</li>
          
          </ul>
          <p>          Microinteractions control an experience with a device or website. Microinteractions are good for accomplishing a task, connecting devices, adjusting settings and many more. We usually dont think about microinteractions but they are so essential to our everyday lives. He used an example of a man that was at the orchestra and his phone wouldnt stop ringing even though it was on silent. The man thought if he turned his sound off that meant all the sounds would stop, but that is not the case, the alarms will still make a sound. This microinteraction that he did not know about was kind of a big deal. Microinteractions may seem so small but it is how it makes our lives easier and helps us out throughout our day to day lives.</p>

    <h1>Dont fear the internet</h1>
    <h3>Russ Maschmeyer</h3>
    <h2><a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296">Video</a></h2>
    <p> In this 3 part series Russ talked about what the internet is and how to build a webpage. The internet is a series of connected computers and servers. When we type in a website it is just code for an IP address. Anyone can visit a website, but it takes special access to be allowed to change a website. There is two types of websites, a static website and a dynamic website. A static website is pretty basic, it has a folder of pages written in html. Htnl is a structure for a website. Css is what is used to make a html website look pretty. Using an external css page makes it easier to have all of your designs in one area, it makes it so you do not have to keep repeating styles over and over. </p>
    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is 3 types of CSS layout</li>
            <li>Inline, internal, external</li>
            <li>You can go into photoshop and look at colors and once you find one that you like just take the code for it and input into your page</li>
            </ul>
